                    <p class="sectionText">Space exploration is the process of discovering and studying the celestial objects and phenomena that exist beyond the Earth's atmosphere. It involves the use of technology and scientific methods to gather data and information about planets, moons, asteroids, comets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p class="sectionText">Currently, with the rockets emitting <em>so</em> much fuel and massive amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> gasses, it's not <em>as</em> sustainable for the environment. Once rocket scientists think of different ways to enhance rockets to make it environmentally sustainable, then yes, it is going to be sustainable. For now though, no.</p>

                    <p class="sectionText">In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit, marking the beginning of the Space Age. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a race to the Moon, with the American Apollo program ultimately achieving the first lunar landing in 1969. In the following decades, spacecraft were sent to explore other planets in our solar system, including Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. Since then, space exploration has continued to advance, with the development of space telescopes like Hubble and the launch of the International Space Station in 1998. Private companies like SpaceX have also entered the space industry, leading to new developments in space tourism and commercial space exploration.</p>
